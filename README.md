## Contributing

### Introduction

100 DAYS OF FEATURE REQUESTS is an extensive 14-week program for developers, product managers, brands and brand owners to obtain guided feature suggestions from a distinguished and diverse community of developers and product managers.

### Getting Started

You can contribute to the 100 Days of Feedback repository by forking the repository in your GitHub account. Make the valuable changes in the repository and after that, make a pull request. Our community team will prioritize the pull requests on a first come first serve basis.

### Editing

If this is the first time you're contributing, follow these steps: 
1. Select **Fork** in the top-right corner of the GitHub page to fork the repository.
2. Create a folder with an appropiate title by clicking on the "Add file" button and then clicking on "Create new file".
3. You will see the editing interface once you click on the "create new file" option, which will help you add contents in the file be it of any extensions.

### Creating Pull Requests

1. When you're ready to submit your changes, add a descriptive title and comments to summarize the changes made.
2. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
3. Check the **Propose file change** button.
4. Scroll down to compare changes with the original document.
5. Select **Create pull request**. 

### Using Labels

Labels are used to track the lifecycle and status of a pull request. Using the correct labels helps with managing workflows and ensuring that content is edited, merged and released at the correct time

### Commenting on Pull Requests

Once a pull request is submitted, multiple committers may comment on it and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Once a pull request has been submitted and the correct label assigned, the review process begins. This includes aligning the content with the Style Guide, validating processes, and tagging any other relevant committers. The community team and tech team will do the reviewing of the pull requests and will inform the owner in accordance with the respective results.

Once the review process is complete, the change will be either merged into master and pushed immediately or merged into the release branch and pushed in alignment with the release. The branch is then deleted.

Any merged PRs with an **Editor Review** or **Reviews Complete** label will be processed by the editor reviewer.
